## Useful command

 ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

-t: This option specifies the type of key to create. In this case, rsa is the type of key to generate.

rsa: RSA is a popular algorithm for secure data transmission and is commonly used for SSH key generation.

-b: This option specifies the number of bits in the generated key. The 4096 value means that the generated key will have 4096 bits.

-C: This option sets a comment or label for the key. The value following the -C option is used as the comment and is typically set to an email address or some other identifier. In the example, "your_email@example.com" is the comment.
